# CDCR Use of Force Data

This repository is a project by KQED regarding Use of Force cases by prisons in California. Specifically, we aim to compare these cases among the different prisons as a rate adjusted by population of the prison. We are only looking at High Security prisons from the years 2008 to 2023. 

CDCR does not publish historical data, so we drew from multiple sources. Some were obtains from COMPSTAT reports, others directly from public records requests.
